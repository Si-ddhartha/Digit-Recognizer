# Digit-Recognizer
Implemented a 2-layer neural network to recognize handwritten digits from 0-9 without using any deep learning libraries like TenserFlow or PyTorch. The motive behind implementing the neural network from scratch is to gain a deeper understanding of how neural networks work and the mathematical principles behind them.
