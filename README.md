# Digit-Recognizer
A 2 layer neural network that is designed to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

The input layer consists of 784 nodes, one for each pixel in a 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten digit. The hidden layer consists of a certain number of nodes, each of which receives a weighted sum of the input values and then passes the result through an activation function. The output layer consists of 10 nodes, one for each possible digit (0-9), and produces a probability distribution over the possible digit values. During training, the network adjusts the weights on the connections between the layers to minimize the error between the predicted digit and the actual digit in the training data.

By implementing the neural network without using any deep learning libraries, the project requires a solid understanding of the underlying mathematical principles of neural networks and allows for greater flexibility in designing and optimizing the model.
